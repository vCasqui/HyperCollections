<h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In the first stage of the project, you will create a simple immutable generic collection. The elements of the collection shouldn't change under any circumstances. To implement this properly is actually more difficult than it seems at the first glance. </p><p>After completing this stage, you will already have understood the general approaches used in this project. However, you might have a question: why do we need a collection that can't be changed at all? In fact, working with immutable data is very convenient and allows avoiding many possible mistakes. <strong>Immutability</strong> is a crucial concept in this project. Remember the <code class="language-java">String</code> class, whose elements can't be modified either.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>This stage will reveal to you all the key ideas, restrictions, and agreements that you should use throughout the project to successfully complete it.</p><ol><li><p>You should create a <strong>public</strong> <strong>final</strong> class named <code class="language-java">ImmutableCollection</code> in <strong>collections</strong> package.</p></li><li><p>The class should contain a static factory method called <code class="language-java">of</code> that takes an arbitrary number of elements as an argument and returns an implementation of it (i.e. an instance of the <code class="language-java">ImmutableCollection</code> class).</p></li><li><p>The invocation <code class="language-java">ImmutableCollection.of()</code> should create an empty collection, whereas the invocation <code class="language-java">ImmutableCollection.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code> should create a five-element collection.</p></li><li><p>If any of the passed elements changes in the external code, it shouldn't change within the collection.</p></li><li><p>If any of the passed elements is null, the method <code class="language-java">of</code> should throw NPE.</p></li><li><p>The class should contain the <code class="language-java">boolean contains(E element)</code> method that checks whether the collection contains a specified element.</p></li><li><p>The class should provide <code class="language-java">int size()</code> and <code class="language-java">boolean isEmpty()</code> methods that check the size of the collection and whether it is empty, respectively.</p></li></ol><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>To implement this, you should use a utility class called <code class="language-java">Objects</code>. It has a set of convenient static methods to work with the <code class="language-java">null</code> value, compare references, and so on. Using this class will make your code more error-prone and well-readable.</p></div><p></p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>Here is an example of how to work with the collection:</p><pre><code class="language-java">ImmutableCollection&lt;?&gt; emptyCollection = ImmutableCollection.of();
System.out.println(emptyCollection.size()); // 0
System.out.println(emptyCollection.isEmpty()); // true

Student student1 = new Student(1, "Student 1", "Email 1");

ImmutableCollection&lt;Student&gt; addresses = ImmutableCollection.of(
    student1,
    new Student(2, "Student 2", "Email 2"),
    new Student(3, "Student 3", "Email 3"),
    new Student(4, "Student 4", "Email 4"),
    new Student(5, "Student 5", "Email 5")
);

Student student = new Student(1, "Student 1", "Email 1");
System.out.println(addresses.contains(student)); // true

ImmutableCollection&lt;Integer&gt; collection = ImmutableCollection.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
System.out.println(collection.isEmpty()); // false
System.out.println(collection.size()); // 5</code></pre><p>Note: you don't need to implement the <code class="language-java">main</code> method. </p>
